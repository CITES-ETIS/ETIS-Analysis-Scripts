These analysis scripts were used to run the ETIS analysis presented to CITES CoP20.

Scripts are divided into 3 parts. Each part can be run from its wrapper script:

- 1-Data_Processing:
  - Convert data csvs from the ETIS Online database into usable seizures data with trade route information
  - Build weight models and perform Weight estimation for records with missing weights
  - Calculate covariates for modelling seizure rate and reporting rate bias-adjustment

- 2-Trend_Analysis:
  - Fit Bayesian hierarchical trend models and perform model averaging
  - Fit weight models and simulate weights for the Weight Index
  - Plot Transaction Index and Weight Index

- 3-Cluster_Analysis:
  - Perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering on country-level variables
  - Perfrom sensitivity analysis with respect to posterior uncertainty in clustering variables
